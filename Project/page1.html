                    <p>Water pollution has drastically limited the availability of Earth’s freshwater, 
                        leaving us with less than 1% of it usable. Water’s unique ability to dissolve more
                         substances than any other liquid makes it particularly vulnerable to contamination 
                         from harmful chemicals and toxins. These pollutants degrade water quality, rendering 
                         it toxic and unsuitable for use. Beyond harming humans, water pollution significantly 
                         impacts ecosystems. Contributors include agriculture, sewage and wastewater, oil, and
                          radioactive substances.

                    <p>Agriculture, as the largest consumer of water, accounts for 70% of the Earth's water usage, 
                        encompassing farming and livestock production. Agricultural activities introduce pollutants 
                        such as pesticides, fertilizers, and animal waste into waterways through runoff. This runoff
                         carries harmful chemicals, excessive nutrients, and bacteria, polluting water and disrupting
                          aquatic ecosystems. Untreated runoff reintroduces these contaminants into the environment,
                          further threatening aquatic life. For example, agricultural nutrients like nitrogen and 
                          phosphorus can cause algal blooms, which are toxic to wildlife and pose health risks to humans.</p>

                    <p>Sewage and wastewater are also major contributors to water pollution. Stormwater runoff
                         transports salt, oil, grease, trash, and other road pollutants into sewage systems or
                          directly into waterways, often without treatment. Wastewater includes water used in 
                          daily activities such as bathing, washing, and sanitation, as well as water from industrial 
                          and commercial processes. UNESCO reports that over 80% of the world’s wastewater is 
                          released back into the environment untreated or not reused, furthering the problem.</p>

                    <p>Oil is another significant pollutant, as it does not mix with water and creates lasting damage.
                         While large oil spills capture public attention, most oil pollution originates from everyday 
                         activities such as oil and gasoline leaks from vehicles and operations in the shipping industry. 
                         Thousands of ships navigate global waters daily, introducing oil into the oceans through 
                         accidental spills, routine maintenance, and tank cleaning.</p>

                <p>The consequences of water pollution are far-reaching, impacting human health, ecosystems, and
                        biodiversity. According to the EPA, approximately 3.5 million Americans annually suffer 
                        from illnesses such as skin rashes, respiratory infections, and hepatitis caused by
                        sewage-contaminated coastal waters. Water pollution renders freshwater undrinkable and 
                        restricts recreational activities like swimming, fishing, and beach visits. Moreover, 
                        pollution leads to algal blooms, which deplete oxygen levels in water—a process known as
                        eutrophication. This suffocates aquatic life in smaller water bodies and produces
                        neurotoxins in oceans, harming larger marine species such as whales and sea turtles.
                            Additionally, the chemicals introduced into waterways can alter the reproduction and
                            behavior of aquatic organisms. These pollutants ultimately climb the food chain, 
                            showing that water pollution impacts us all.</p>

                        <p>Millions of tons of plastic enter the ocean, affecting nearly 900 marine species. In five
                            major ocean areas, massive amounts of plastic have accumulated, with the largest being 
                            the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP), located between Hawaii and California. Spanning 
                            an estimated 1.6 million square kilometers, the GPGP poses severe risks to marine life. 
                            Plastic can entangle and suffocate animals or kill them when ingested. Once in the ocean,
                            plastic begins breaking down into microplastics, which are even more dangerous. Marine 
                            animals often mistake microplastics for food, ingesting toxic pollutants that can travel 
                            up the food chain and eventually harm humans. Because microplastics are harder to clean up, 
                            The Ocean Cleanup has developed technology to intercept plastic waste before it breaks down.

                        <p>This technology, called System 03, is designed to gather and concentrate floating plastic in 
                            the ocean, making collection more efficient. System 03 consists of a U-shaped barrier that 
                            floats on the water’s surface, with a large net extending beneath it. The net is fine enough
                            to capture plastics just millimeters in size while allowing small plankton to pass through. 
                            It is also long enough to capture large debris, such as discarded fishing nets.

                    <p>The U-shaped barrier guides plastic debris to the base of the system, where an opening leads 
                        to a netted tunnel known as the retention zone. With the aid of active propulsion, System 03 
                        moves slowly at 1.5 knots, relying on ocean currents to direct plastic into the retention zone. 
                        When the zone is full, vessels retrieve the collected debris. The net can be sealed, detached,
                        and brought on board for emptying. Once the vessels are filled, the waste is sent for recycling.
                        Currently, System 03 is actively deployed in the GPGP.

                    <p>While concerns exist about potential harm to marine life, The Ocean Cleanup has implemented 
                        several safety measures to minimize risks. Green LED lights surround the system, warning 
                        marine animals of its presence and indicating escape routes. Acoustic deterrents emit 
                        high-frequency sounds to keep animals at a safe distance. Additionally, cameras monitor for 
                        any signs of animal presence near the system.</p>

                <p>If an animal becomes trapped, escape aids within the retention zone help ensure their safety. 
                    The Marine Animal Safety Hatch (MASH) opens a hatch at the bottom of the netting, allowing 
                    trapped animals to swim out while preventing garbage from escaping. The retention zone is 
                    positioned slightly above the surface to enable animals like dolphins to breathe if they cannot 
                    immediately find the escape hatches. In emergencies, a release mechanism at the end of the
                    retention zone allows for the immediate release of both the trapped animal and the debris.
                    These measures aim to balance effective ocean cleanup with the preservation of marine life.
