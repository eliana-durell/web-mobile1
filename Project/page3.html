                        Plastic is renowned for its durability and long lifespan, but this quality comes at a 
                        cost—it doesn’t decompose but instead breaks down into microplastics, which are even 
                        more challenging to clean up. Among the most prevalent contributors to ocean pollution
                         are plastic water bottles, which are primarily made from polyethylene terephthalate,
                         a material with a staggering half-life of over 2,500 years. Beyond water bottles, 
                         discarded plastics also include containers, wrappers, and soda can holders. Together,
                          these items dominate ocean pollution, with studies showing that 80% of ocean trash is
                           plastic. Every day, approximately 8 million pieces of plastic make their way into 
                           marine ecosystems, posing a significant threat to wildlife.

                    <p>Marine life, including seabirds, turtles, and fish, often ingest microplastics, mistaking them 
                        for food. These plastics don’t just harm marine creatures—they make their way up the food chain,
                         eventually impacting humans. Microplastics can absorb toxic substances such as polychlorinated
                          biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs). These chemicals, used in 
                          industrial and agricultural applications, have been linked to endocrine disruption and 
                          even certain cancers. For people who consume seafood, ingesting these harmful chemicals 
                          is an alarming consequence of plastic pollution.</p>

                        <p>In response to the growing crisis, Biogone, an Australian company, has developed
                             landfill-biodegradable plastics designed to combat the persistence of microplastics. 
                             Their innovative products, such as trash bags, plastic wrap, dog waste bags, and 
                             medical gloves, offer the same strength and durability as traditional plastics while 
                             addressing environmental concerns. The secret lies in a special additive incorporated 
                             into their plastics, which facilitates rapid breakdown in microbe-rich environments 
                             like landfills.

                        <p>When exposed to microbes, the additive in Biogone plastics becomes a food source,
                             prompting the microbes to secrete enzymes that break down the plastic polymer 
                             chains into shorter, digestible molecules. This process transforms the degraded 
                             plastic into a natural plant fertilizer. Testing has shown that Biogone plastics 
                             biodegrade 90% faster than traditional plastics, significantly reducing their 
                             environmental impact.

                         materials in their production. By offering an eco-friendly alternative to conventional
                          plastics, they are paving the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future.
